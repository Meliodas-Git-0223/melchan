# Melchan forum

Open source forum writen in python3 using flask.


Before the starting main.py you may need to:


```
pip install Flask
```

then


```
pip install Flask-login
```

then

```
chmod +x configure
```
and last:

```
./configure
```

./configure creates required directories for server such as static/media, data, data/threads and writes main construction of server-required files

And FINALLY, you can start main.py

```
python3 main.py
```

if you forgot how to start it by bash shell. Also you can use a button to run code in your IDE if you using it.


I`m a bad designer.
