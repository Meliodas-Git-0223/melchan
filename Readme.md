# Melchan forum

Open source forum writen in python3 using flask.


Before the starting main.py you may need to:

bash
```
pip install Flask
```

then

bash
```
pip install Flask-login
```

then

bash
```
./configure
```

configure creates required directories for server such as static/media, data, data/threads and writes main construction of server-required files


I`m a bad designer.
